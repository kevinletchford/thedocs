# Thedocs, home to awesome documentation

Have you ever found an article, or piece of documentation that was so amazing you always come back to it? Mine is the css tricks article on css flexbox <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>.

Over time we find these awesome links and docs, and you save them to memory or to your bookmarks - but they get lost and forgotten. This project aims to take these high level articles and curate them into a collection that you can always come back to.
